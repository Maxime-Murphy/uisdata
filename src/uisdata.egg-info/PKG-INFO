# ***uisdata*** library
*uisdata* is a library for easy data access and manipulation of the datasets offered by the [**UNESCO Institute for Statistics** (UIS)](http://uis.unesco.org/).

## Library modules
*uisdata.bdds* is the first module developed to consume the dataset archives of the [**Bulk Data Download System (BDDS)**](https://apiportal.uis.unesco.org/bdds) repository. 

- Access any BDDS zip archive; download the archive from the repo to memory or access the archive on your local drive 
- Subset the datasets based on lists of countries, years and indicators
- Merge a dataset with its metadata (as columns or as a dictionary)
- Merge a dataset with its country and indicator labels
- Wrapper to do all the above with a single method
- Reshape tables from long to wide format (multiple options)
- Search utility to create lists of indicators and regions
- ... more to come ... 

*uisdata.api* coming in 2022...

## Source code and installation
The test version of the source code is currently hosted on PyPi at:  
https://test.pypi.org/project/uisdata/

## Python requirement
*uisdata* requires a python 64-bit version. 
It has not been tested extensively to find the minimal viable version, but it will work on: 
**python** >=3.6  (64-bit)

## Installation of the test version
    pip install --upgrade --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple uisdata

## Modules Dependencies
*uisdata.bdds* has not been tested extensively to find the minimal viable versions for its dependencies.  
It requires the following libraries:  
**requests** - a standard for making HTTP requests in Python. It abstracts the complexities of making requests behind a simple API.    
**pandas** - an open-source Python Library providing high-performance data manipulation and analysis tool using its powerful data structures.    
**numpy** - NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

## Background
Work on *uisdata* started at UIS (UNESCO Institute for Statistics) in 2021 for facilitating programmatic access to the UIS datasets. It is still under active development, and we will be adding features in future iterations.

## Tutorials / use-case
[*.bdds* Use-case](https://datalore.jetbrains.com/notebook/FaD1hIZ0s0XKrlZcWTMYVW/UrrXOcYJWCstRNMNPvzzPF/) is provided through dataLore.  
Clone the notebook to your dataLore account (sign-up required). 
Note that the library will self-update to the latest version.
